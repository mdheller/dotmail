# dotmail

This is a FERN-stack app to programatically send responsively-designed emails with nodemailer + mjml templates

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

All dependencies listed in `package.json`.

Create a firebase project for authentication and user data permanence. This project currently supports Nodemailer SMTP connection to gmail.com or AWS SES send email and thus requires a Gmail account or AWS account with a non-sandboxed SES to operate.

Create a folder named `data` in the root directory to store MJML templates to transpile, inject, and send. See below for `example.mjml`:

```
<mjml>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-text font-size="20px" color="red">Hello World</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
```

Create a .env in the root directory with the following:

```
PORT=3000
FIREBASE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN='YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE'
FIREBASE_DB_URL='YOUR_DB_URL_HERE'
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID='YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE'
```

### Installing

To install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Development

To run server

```
npm start
```

To run webpack

```
npm run react-dev

## API

To send an email with dotmail just POST to `/api/send` with well-formed JSON:

```
curl -d 'EXAMPLE_JSON_BODY' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/send
```

```
EXAMPLE_JSON_BODY

{
  "form": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Example",
    "type": "universal",
    "subjectLine": "Example subject line",
    "injections": [
      {
        "name": "exampleInjection",
        "type": "text",
        "data": "This is an example"
      }
    ]
},
  "currentUser": { "name": "John Smith", "email": "example@gmail.com" },
  "recipients": [
    {
      "firstName": "exampleFirstName",
      "lastName": "exampleLastName",
      "preferred": "examplePreferredName",
      "email": "exampleRecipientAddress@gmail.com"
    }
  ]
}
```
